BORDER SECURITY_2015 (VOLUME  2 OF 2),9/14/2015,    I do.,brown
BORDER SECURITY_2015 (VOLUME  2 OF 2),9/14/2015,"    Good morning, Chairman Johnson, Ranking _x000D_
Member Carper, and other Members of the Committee. I am honored _x000D_
to be here today to discuss the Coast Guard's role in securing _x000D_
our Nation's borders. I thank you for your strong support of _x000D_
the Coast Guard and our men and women in uniform._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    \1\ The prepared statement of Rear Admiral Brown appears in the _x000D_
Appendix on page 1446._x000D_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------_x000D_
    It is also a pleasure to be here with two of our most _x000D_
important partners in maritime border security: Customs and _x000D_
Border Protection and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement._x000D_
    The Coast Guard's success is due in no part to the _x000D_
partnerships that we have with these two organizations, and I _x000D_
would personally like to thank both Executive Director Edge and _x000D_
Assistant Commissioner Alles for their ongoing support and _x000D_
leadership._x000D_
    My complete statement has been provided to the Committee, _x000D_
and I would ask that it be entered into the record._x000D_
    Mr. Chairman, maintaining border security while _x000D_
facilitating lawful travel and trade is a fundamental national _x000D_
security interest, requiring comprehensive, coordinated efforts _x000D_
across many departments and agencies and, in particular, the _x000D_
Department of Homeland Security (DHS). As members of the _x000D_
Committee are aware, over 90 percent of global trade travels _x000D_
through maritime conveyances, making the safety and security of _x000D_
our maritime borders both an economic and national security _x000D_
imperative._x000D_
    The Coast Guard conducts operations every day to protect, _x000D_
prevent, and respond to a broad range of maritime border _x000D_
security threats, including illicit trafficking of narcotics _x000D_
and people by organized criminal networks, undocumented _x000D_
migration, the exploitation of our natural resources, potential _x000D_
terrorist activities, and the disruption of maritime commerce. _x000D_
So our strategy is to secure the borders in a layered defense, _x000D_
one that engages with foreign partners and takes action far _x000D_
from U.S. shores where threats to security and national _x000D_
sovereignty emanate. Our strategy focuses on exerting our _x000D_
unique authorities and capabilities in the maritime domain _x000D_
before those threats land in our ports, on our beaches, or at _x000D_
our borders._x000D_
    Overseas, the Coast Guard assesses foreign port security _x000D_
and the antiterrorism measures of international trading _x000D_
partners through the International Port Security Program. These _x000D_
activities aim to ensure that cargo bound for the United States _x000D_
meets all United States and international security standards. _x000D_
Additionally, in coordination with Customs and Border _x000D_
Protection, we receive and screen notices of arrival for both _x000D_
cargo and personnel long before commercial vessels arrive in _x000D_
the United States. We have liaison and attache officers posted _x000D_
at multiple embassies overseas and facilitate action across the _x000D_
full spectrum of maritime governance._x000D_
    Closer to shore, using our major cutters, maritime patrol _x000D_
aircraft, armed helicopters, and law enforcement detachments, _x000D_
we deploy assets to intercept those threats where they are most _x000D_
vulnerable: at sea. Along with our national security cutters, _x000D_
the Coast Guard's essential effort to recapitalize its fleet _x000D_
through the Offshore Patrol Cutter Acquisition Project will _x000D_
ensure that the Coast Guard is capable of projecting vital law _x000D_
enforcement presence on the high seas, in the 200-mile U.S. _x000D_
Exclusive Economic Zone, in our customs waters, and in our _x000D_
territorial seas for decades to come._x000D_
    The Coast Guard is the only U.S. Government component that _x000D_
has at all times both defense and law enforcement authority and _x000D_
is able to make inquiries, examinations, inspections, searches, _x000D_
seizures, and arrests for violation of U.S. laws both on the _x000D_
high seas and in U.S. waters. By maintaining that overt _x000D_
presence offshore and in the littoral region, the Coast Guard _x000D_
has interdicted more than 2,600 undocumented migrants this year _x000D_
alone and deterred many more from taking to the sea in _x000D_
dangerously overcrowded and unseaworthy vessels._x000D_
    Likewise, just this past June, the Coast Guard conducted 22 _x000D_
maritime interdictions, supported by CBP and others, that _x000D_
resulted in the detention of more than 60 suspects and removed _x000D_
more than 14 metric tons of pure uncut cocaine. In one case, _x000D_
our new national security cutter Stratton, using onboard _x000D_
sensors and law enforcement intelligence gained from other _x000D_
interdictions, located and seized a semi-submersible vessel _x000D_
with 2.8 metric tons of cocaine in the Pacific Ocean. This _x000D_
product was ultimately destined for the United States and would _x000D_
have left a trail of corruption, instability, and death as it _x000D_
moved through Central America and Mexico._x000D_
    Through a single month of interdictions, the Coast Guard _x000D_
denied criminal networks more than $480 million in wholesale _x000D_
drug proceeds and profits. Cases such as these that result in _x000D_
the detection and prosecution of traffickers generate _x000D_
additional actionable intelligence and fuel our cycle of _x000D_
success. Over the last decade, law enforcement intelligence _x000D_
gained from Coast Guard interdictions contributed to the arrest _x000D_
and extradition of nearly 75 percent of all drug kingpins who _x000D_
were extradited to the United States._x000D_
    Successfully patrolling and enforcing the maritime border _x000D_
requires a strategic outlook, tactical execution, and _x000D_
Department of Homeland Security unity of effort. Along the _x000D_
Southern Border, the Coast Guard operates within a new DHS _x000D_
Southern Border and Approaches Campaign Plan. The three task _x000D_
forces set up under the Campaign Plan--Joint Task Forces East, _x000D_
West, and Investigations--operate cooperatively to maintain _x000D_
effective border security, and Coast Guard Vice Admiral Dean _x000D_
Lee is the Director for the Joint Task Force East._x000D_
    In addition, the Commandant, Admiral Zukunft, has signed _x000D_
the Coast Guard Western Hemisphere Strategy that outlines three _x000D_
priorities: combating networks, securing borders, and _x000D_
safeguarding commerce._x000D_
    Thank you, sir.",brown
BORDER SECURITY_2015 (VOLUME  2 OF 2),9/14/2015,"    Yes, sir. The estimate that we have a _x000D_
national target of reducing about 40 percent of the cocaine _x000D_
supply approaching the United States. That is the nationally _x000D_
set target. It has been a graduated target. It is 36 percent _x000D_
this year. It is moving up toward 40 percent._x000D_
    Over the past several years, we have averaged between about _x000D_
11 and 18 percent in terms of maritime interdictions of the _x000D_
known drug flow toward the United States. One of the challenges _x000D_
of that, as was mentioned earlier with regard to maritime _x000D_
domain awareness, is this is illicit activity that is trying to _x000D_
be concealed for detection. So our confidence in what we call _x000D_
the denominator of that, the actual flow, is somewhat limited, _x000D_
but based on best estimates of the intelligence community (IC) _x000D_
and the law enforcement community, in the maritime we interdict _x000D_
in the range of 11 to 18 percent. For the Coast Guard it has _x000D_
been about 450 metric tons over the past 5 years.",brown
BORDER SECURITY_2015 (VOLUME  2 OF 2),9/14/2015,"    Yes, Senator. I would add that in the _x000D_
maritime domain, we have seen relatively small quantities of _x000D_
heroin, typically mixed in with loads of cocaine. For example, _x000D_
just about a month or so ago, we had an interdiction of a bulk _x000D_
quantity of cocaine, several hundred kilos, off the coast of _x000D_
Central America, and embedded within one of those cocaine _x000D_
packages was approximately 10 kilograms of heroin. We have also _x000D_
seen that on the Caribbean side, again, in relatively small _x000D_
quantities. But as Mr. Alles mentioned, the vast majority of _x000D_
heroin that comes into the United States does so across the _x000D_
land border, not a maritime border. But our Intelligence _x000D_
Community remains alert to instances of heroin trafficking in _x000D_
the maritime, and to the extent that we can, we interdict those _x000D_
when we know they are coming.",brown
BORDER SECURITY_2015 (VOLUME  2 OF 2),9/14/2015,"    I will try to be brief, Senator. The first _x000D_
one is support for the recapitalization of our offshore patrol _x000D_
fleet, specifically the offshore patrol cutter acquisition. And _x000D_
kind of following up on Senator Ayotte's question before, what _x000D_
would it take for us to be more effective, our effectiveness in _x000D_
our maritime interdiction role is based really on three things:_x000D_
    Information, actionable intelligence. That is generated _x000D_
primarily through General Kelly's command, U.S. Southern _x000D_
Command (SOUTHCOM), and their Joint Interagency Task Force _x000D_
South (JIATF-S)._x000D_
    Aviation. We need fixed-wing air support to locate the _x000D_
targets that JIATF points us to. That is a combination of CBP _x000D_
aircraft, Coast Guard aircraft, and partner nation aircraft._x000D_
    And then we need ships on station, and our long-range _x000D_
cutters, our high-endurance cutters, medium-endurance cutters, _x000D_
and the new national security cutter. And the future OPC _x000D_
equipped with a helicopter flight deck, an airborne use-of-_x000D_
force helicopter, multiple pursuit boats, and a seasoned Coast _x000D_
Guard crew and boarding teams are the most effective package in _x000D_
interdicting these threats, whether drug-trafficking threats, _x000D_
migrant-trafficking threats, or whether those criminal pathways _x000D_
are ultimately used for terrorism.",brown
BORDER SECURITY_2015 (VOLUME  2 OF 2),9/14/2015,"    We are still examining the marks between the _x000D_
Senate and the House on the----",brown
BORDER SECURITY_2015 (VOLUME  2 OF 2),9/14/2015,"    We believe there is sufficient _x000D_
appropriations to continue with our acquisition program of _x000D_
record to recapitalize the fleet. Obviously if we had more, we _x000D_
could do better, but they are sufficient to recapitalize on our _x000D_
program of record which will give us 8 national security _x000D_
cutters, 25 offshore patrol cutters, and 58 fast response _x000D_
cutters for coastal operations.",brown
BORDER SECURITY_2015 (VOLUME  2 OF 2),9/14/2015,"    That is correct. Our program of record is _x000D_
for the eight national security cutters that are already _x000D_
budgeted for and the offshore patrol cutter that is currently _x000D_
in preliminary design, and that acquisition will stretch out _x000D_
over a number of years into the future as our current medium-_x000D_
endurance cutters approach, some of them have exceeded, and all _x000D_
of them will ultimately exceed 50 years in service before they _x000D_
are retired as these new cutters replace them.",brown
BORDER SECURITY_2015 (VOLUME  2 OF 2),9/14/2015,"    Certainly. As I mentioned earlier, the Joint _x000D_
Interagency Task Force South, a DOD command under the _x000D_
leadership of General Kelly and his SOUTHCOM command, has the _x000D_
lawful responsibility for detecting and monitoring illicit _x000D_
traffic coming toward the United States. They do that using _x000D_
both national intelligence means and law enforcement _x000D_
intelligence from not only other complements of DHS but also _x000D_
the Department of Justice (DOJ) and numerous foreign partners. _x000D_
We have terrific foreign cooperation down there that alerts _x000D_
JIATF South to literally thousands of drug movements toward the _x000D_
United States every year._x000D_
    However, as we talked about, we are resource constrained in _x000D_
terms of aviation and surface ships so that only roughly 35 to _x000D_
40 percent of those targets, of those potential targets _x000D_
actually become active targets searched for with aircraft._x000D_
    So the intelligence systems work very well. They do a great _x000D_
job of fusing national level intelligence with law enforcement _x000D_
intelligence, and we have multiple partnerships to keep that _x000D_
happening.",brown
BORDER SECURITY_2015 (VOLUME  2 OF 2),9/14/2015,"    I think if I may, Senator, I will tackle the _x000D_
precursors issue. We have talked a lot about the Joint _x000D_
Interagency Task Force South, which is focused in the Western _x000D_
Hemisphere, looking primarily at cocaine production coming from _x000D_
South America toward the United States. DOD also has a Joint _x000D_
Interagency Task Force West, based in Hawaii and looking _x000D_
westward toward Asia, the source of many of these precursor _x000D_
chemicals. One of their primary duties is to track those _x000D_
precursors as they approach Central America. It used to mostly _x000D_
be Mexico, now it is mostly Guatemala. And so they do a _x000D_
reasonably effective job of tracking those precursors. Mexico _x000D_
has clamped down substantially on precursor chemicals coming _x000D_
through that country. Now they are going to Guatemala._x000D_
    So as part of the Southern Border and Approaches Campaign _x000D_
Plan and part of the wider Central America strategy for the _x000D_
entirety of the Federal Government, we are looking to, with _x000D_
multiple partners, improve the governance across Guatemala and _x000D_
the other countries in Central America so they can improve _x000D_
their own port security and do a better job of clamping down _x000D_
both on precursor chemicals and on production.",brown
BORDER SECURITY_2015 (VOLUME  2 OF 2),9/14/2015,"    OK. Thank you for that question, Senator. In _x000D_
talking about the Migration Accords, the Migration Accord or _x000D_
agreement that we have with Cuba dates back to the mass _x000D_
migrations of the mid-1990s. So since the 1994-95 timeframe, we _x000D_
have had agreement that allows for the direct repatriation of _x000D_
Cuban migrants who are interdicted at sea and are then screened _x000D_
to ensure that they are not going to be subject to persecution _x000D_
or torture upon potential return to Cuba. We then have a well-_x000D_
facilitated repatriation mechanism by which Coast Guard cutters _x000D_
go into a particular Cuban port, repatriate those migrants to _x000D_
the custody of the Ministry of the Interior._x000D_
    I had the opportunity from 1998 to 2000 to serve as the _x000D_
Coast Guard's essentially liaison officer to the Cuban Border _x000D_
Guard. And since 2000, we have had somebody permanently _x000D_
stationed at the U.S. Interests Section in Havana to help _x000D_
facilitate that part of the relationship, and it is a very _x000D_
professional working relationship that we have with the Cuban _x000D_
Border Guard. And as relationships change with Cuba, we see _x000D_
that potentially being an avenue for continued cooperation in _x000D_
other matters of law enforcement and security.",brown
BORDER SECURITY_2015 (VOLUME  2 OF 2),9/14/2015,"    We would say with all forms of illicit _x000D_
migration and unsafe migration by sea, they are often driven _x000D_
by, if not the policy itself, the perception of the policy, _x000D_
which is often exploited by criminal migrant smugglers who _x000D_
charge people money on the dream that they will arrive in the _x000D_
United States.",brown
BORDER SECURITY_2015 (VOLUME  2 OF 2),9/14/2015,"    Thank you for that question, Senator. I _x000D_
think I will tackle the ice-breaking piece of it first and then _x000D_
the security aspects._x000D_
    With regard to ice breaking, we have seen record winters, _x000D_
particularly the winter of 2014, and a cooperative agreement _x000D_
between the U.S. Coast Guard and the Canadian Coast Guard _x000D_
provided ice breaker coverage to the extent that the United _x000D_
States, we are not prepared to provide on our own. We have a _x000D_
number of 140-foot ice-breaking tugs as well as our 225-foot _x000D_
buoy tenders as well as the Coast Guard cutter Mackinaw, our _x000D_
only heavy ice breaker on the Great Lakes._x000D_
    Canada has a little bit more capacity and works with us _x000D_
very cooperatively on ice breaking to keep the shipping _x000D_
channels open as long as possible, and we foresee that _x000D_
relationship continuing in the future. We also have an in-_x000D_
service vessel sustainment program to upgrade the 140-foot ice-_x000D_
breaking tugs to continue them in service for an extended _x000D_
period of time. So we think that from an ice-breaking _x000D_
standpoint, we have sufficient capacity on the Great Lakes for _x000D_
the foreseeable future for most winters, with help from the _x000D_
Canadians in the heaviest periods._x000D_
    With regard to the security relationship, we have a great _x000D_
working relationship with Canadians both from an intelligence _x000D_
and operations perspective. The Coast Guard has a ship rider _x000D_
agreement with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police that cross-_x000D_
deputizes officers of the two services to ride on each other's _x000D_
vessels so the border cannot be used as an escape route _x000D_
essentially for someone who is conducting some type of _x000D_
nefarious activity. We also have an intelligence relationship _x000D_
with Canada that allows us to share information both about the _x000D_
border itself and about other threats._x000D_
    And the last point I want to make about Canada is that they _x000D_
also recognize that border threats do not emanate right at _x000D_
their border with the United States. Many of them come from _x000D_
farther away. So the government of Canada, through the Canadian _x000D_
Navy, provides Canadian naval ships that assist us with Coast _x000D_
Guard boarding teams on board to interdict drugs as far away as _x000D_
the coast of South America. So they have been terrific partners _x000D_
in all ways.",brown
BORDER SECURITY_2015 (VOLUME  2 OF 2),9/14/2015,"    We work that primarily in conjunction with _x000D_
Border Patrol, and I would leave that to Mr. Alles.",brown
BORDER SECURITY_2015 (VOLUME  2 OF 2),9/14/2015,"    OK. It is slightly different than that, _x000D_
Senator. The 11 to 18 percent is of the estimated flow, total _x000D_
drug flow toward the United States, we interdict--by weight, we _x000D_
reduce that supply by about 11 to 18 percent with a national _x000D_
target of 36 percent, going up to 40._x000D_
    With regard to individual events about which we have known _x000D_
intelligence, JIATF South and SOUTHCOM estimate that they can _x000D_
only target about 37 percent of those events, but that overall, _x000D_
once they locate a vessel or actual--the Coast Guard's kind of _x000D_
interdiction performance, once a vessel has been sighted as a _x000D_
target, our interdiction performance is between 85 and 90 _x000D_
percent. So it really is a matter of turning the known _x000D_
intelligence into a sighting or a detection that we can then _x000D_
target with the vessel, with the ship-helicopter-boarding team _x000D_
combination.",brown
BORDER SECURITY_2015 (VOLUME  2 OF 2),9/14/2015,"    I would say that as a government, aviation, _x000D_
long--persistent surveillance, whether it is in the form of _x000D_
fixed-wing aviation, national assets, unmanned systems, _x000D_
persistent surveillance that can be targeted until a very _x000D_
thinly populated fleet of surface vessels can get there.",brown
BORDER SECURITY_2015 (VOLUME  2 OF 2),9/14/2015,"    Correct. And when you mention the vast _x000D_
ocean, just in the eastern Pacific alone, the area that we are _x000D_
talking about is an area equivalent to the continental United _x000D_
States that may be patrolled by three to four ships at a time.",brown
BORDER SECURITY_2015 (VOLUME  2 OF 2),9/14/2015,"    All of which have to refuel somewhere on the _x000D_
east coast, notionally speaking. And I mentioned earlier, in _x000D_
addition to the information, much of which we have, the _x000D_
aviation, much of which we do not have, and the ships on _x000D_
station, right now the Coast Guard is significantly challenged _x000D_
by our ability to keep our older ships, our 30-to 50-year-old _x000D_
medium-endurance cutters on station. Last week alone, while we _x000D_
projected to have seven ships on station in the Caribbean and _x000D_
the Florida Straits, we actually only had two because five of _x000D_
them had mission-limiting casualties. And so the _x000D_
recapitalization of our offshore patrol cutter fleet becomes to _x000D_
us the linchpin of success for decades to come.",brown
BORDER SECURITY_2015 (VOLUME  2 OF 2),9/14/2015,"    Well, thanks to some great efforts by our _x000D_
logistic system, those ships are back up and operating. But, _x000D_
again, we missed almost a week on station for many of them, and _x000D_
that time on station cannot be regained.",brown
BORDER SECURITY_2015 (VOLUME  2 OF 2),9/14/2015,"    I think perhaps Mr. Alles could comment on _x000D_
that more effectively based on his experience in aviation?",brown
BORDER SECURITY_2015 (VOLUME  2 OF 2),9/14/2015,"    In the maritime domain, the number of Cuban _x000D_
migrants that have attempted to come to the United States has _x000D_
upticked over the past 2 years, fiscal years 2014 and 2015, as _x000D_
compared with the 5 years prior. But, still, that level remains _x000D_
below kind of our 10-year historical average._x000D_
    So we perceived a slight uptick shortly after the _x000D_
announcement of change in relationships. As I mentioned _x000D_
earlier, we think that the perception of U.S. policy or _x000D_
potential change in U.S. policy is often a driver of migration _x000D_
and often fueled by migrant-smuggling organizations that profit _x000D_
from that uncertainty.",brown
BORDER SECURITY_2015 (VOLUME  2 OF 2),9/14/2015,"    That number has since gone back down on a _x000D_
month-to-month basis compared to what we saw in December and _x000D_
January. And, again, it is back down to historical norms now.",brown
BORDER SECURITY_2015 (VOLUME  2 OF 2),9/14/2015,"    That is accurate, sir. Normally, in the _x000D_
winter months the flow trails off, so those numbers were fairly _x000D_
high. The numbers now month to month are about 300, which, for _x000D_
the summertime, is about normal and certainly well within the _x000D_
normal range. And I would add that this perception of policy _x000D_
issue, as Mr. Alles said before, applies not only to Cuban _x000D_
migrants but to Haitian migrants as well. A few years ago, we _x000D_
saw a significant spike in Haitian migrants trying to go from _x000D_
the Dominican Republic toward Puerto Rico. We were then able to _x000D_
come up with a policy solution to that of expedited removal of _x000D_
Haitians who had landed in Puerto Rico or the islands of the _x000D_
pass between Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico, and we were _x000D_
able to get a lid on that._x000D_
    So it is a combination of policy, operations, but also _x000D_
public messaging in addition to the additional operations _x000D_
effort that we made.",brown
BORDER SECURITY_2015 (VOLUME  2 OF 2),9/14/2015,"    Correct. And as I mentioned before, _x000D_
smuggling organizations absolutely exploit uncertainty or _x000D_
perceived changes in policy to profit from people's desire to _x000D_
get to the United States.",brown
BORDER SECURITY_2015 (VOLUME  2 OF 2),9/14/2015,"    Thank you for that question, Senator. We _x000D_
have had some successes in partnership with CBP on using _x000D_
unmanned aerial systems for interdictions. I recall a very good _x000D_
case off of Puerto Rico where a maritime patrol aircraft first _x000D_
spotted a suspect vessel, then handed it off to an unmanned _x000D_
aerial system that maintained surveillance until a Coast Guard _x000D_
cutter was able to get on scene and do the interdiction. So we _x000D_
have had successes with that._x000D_
    The Coast Guard, in addition to the partnership program _x000D_
with CBP on the Guardian, has also two other unmanned aerial _x000D_
system programs. One is a shipboard UAS program. We have kind _x000D_
of had some fits and starts on that. Some of them, as you have _x000D_
mentioned, Senator, are more people-intensive than we first _x000D_
would have anticipated. In fact, I think within DOD they have _x000D_
actually changed terms from ``unmanned'' to ``remotely _x000D_
piloted'' to put emphasis on the fact that there is still a _x000D_
pilot, just not on board the asset._x000D_
    And then we are also working on small, essentially hand-_x000D_
launched unmanned aerial systems for closer-range surveillance _x000D_
and for a variety of applications. Right now we are testing _x000D_
them in the Arctic for ice breaking, to find leads in the ice _x000D_
and other environmental concerns. So we have multiple programs, _x000D_
all of them in some nascent stage, but we have had some _x000D_
successes.",brown
BORDER SECURITY_2015 (VOLUME  2 OF 2),9/14/2015,"    Thank you, Senator. As I mentioned earlier, _x000D_
there is a Central America strategy now developed out of the _x000D_
National Security Council staff, and Vice President Biden is _x000D_
the one who----",brown
BORDER SECURITY_2015 (VOLUME  2 OF 2),9/14/2015,"    And I think that is terrific, sir. There are _x000D_
three key aspects to that strategy. They include security, _x000D_
governance, and prosperity. And I think the Coast Guard has a _x000D_
role to play, particularly in security and governance, but _x000D_
leading to prosperity. We talked a little bit earlier about _x000D_
precursor chemicals in Guatemala. So shipping out of Central _x000D_
America toward Wilmington, for example, with bananas and juice _x000D_
concentrates could be an important part of their economy if _x000D_
they had a relief from the pressure of corruption and the _x000D_
corrosive effect of cocaine traffic moving through Central _x000D_
America. So I think the appropriations for funding that _x000D_
strategy are a key component of moving forward there, and from _x000D_
a Coast Guard perspective, we want to put more people in the _x000D_
embassies in the country teams to improve our performance in _x000D_
all three aspects: security, governance, and prosperity.",brown
BORDER SECURITY_2015 (VOLUME  2 OF 2),9/14/2015,"    I would say, sir, that the closest analog _x000D_
might be Colombia in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and _x000D_
perhaps Central America is in about that condition now, but _x000D_
with a combination----",brown
BORDER SECURITY_2015 (VOLUME  2 OF 2),9/14/2015,"    Which is not good, but also not hopeless. _x000D_
With a combination of significant national effort by the _x000D_
Government of Colombia and the people of Colombia, as well as a _x000D_
relatively small investment from the United States of people _x000D_
and money and time and resources, Colombia has reduced its _x000D_
murder rate, substantially increased its Gross Domestic Product _x000D_
(GDP), and reestablished the rule of law almost over the _x000D_
entirety of the country, with the exception----",brown
BORDER SECURITY_2015 (VOLUME  2 OF 2),9/14/2015,    It absolutely did.,brown
BORDER SECURITY_2015 (VOLUME  2 OF 2),9/14/2015,"    Right, sir. And so the goal of the Central _x000D_
America strategy is to try to address at the same time the _x000D_
security concerns, the governance, the rule of law, and the _x000D_
institutions there, as well as improving the prosperity so that _x000D_
there is no longer the roots of corruption and also the _x000D_
pressure on people to move out of Central America so that they _x000D_
can rebuild their own countries and economies.",brown
BORDER SECURITY_2015 (VOLUME  2 OF 2),9/14/2015,"    What had happened, sir, was following the _x000D_
earthquake in Haiti in 2010, we had stopped removal of _x000D_
Haitians. And I have to different between repatriation--in the _x000D_
Coast Guard we use repatriation, maritime repatriation, _x000D_
migrants who are interdicted at sea who return to their country _x000D_
of origin or departure--from removal, which is the process _x000D_
after a migrant has landed in the United States.",brown
BORDER SECURITY_2015 (VOLUME  2 OF 2),9/14/2015,"    So we never stopped post-Haiti earthquake _x000D_
the maritime repatriation process. Thankfully, that continued _x000D_
to work, and there was no increase in migration from Haiti in _x000D_
2010 subsequent to the earthquake._x000D_
    However, the expedited removal of Haitians who were already _x000D_
in the United States was stopped at that time and was not _x000D_
resumed. And by 2013, migrant-smuggling organizations in the _x000D_
Dominican Republic began to take advantage of that by bringing _x000D_
Haitians already in the Dominican Republic to uninhabited _x000D_
islands that are U.S. territory between Puerto Rico and the _x000D_
Dominican Republic.",brown
BORDER SECURITY_2015 (VOLUME  2 OF 2),9/14/2015,    Correct.,brown
BORDER SECURITY_2015 (VOLUME  2 OF 2),9/14/2015,"    Right, accompanied by a spike in deaths and _x000D_
injuries of migrants who were attempting to make that cross.",brown
BORDER SECURITY_2015 (VOLUME  2 OF 2),9/14/2015,    Correct.,brown
BORDER SECURITY_2015 (VOLUME  2 OF 2),9/14/2015,"    So we did a couple things. First, working _x000D_
with the Government of the Dominican Republic, we asked them to _x000D_
increase their shore-side enforcement to try to stop this _x000D_
traffic from taking place. And within the U.S. Government, we _x000D_
were able to within our Department and with interagency _x000D_
partners--State, Justice, and others--we were able to _x000D_
reinstitute the policy of expedited removal, and ICE _x000D_
enforcement and removal operations began removing migrants who _x000D_
had recently arrived in Puerto Rico or those uninhabited _x000D_
islands, and very quickly, once that became public knowledge, _x000D_
the traffic across that vector essentially dried up.",brown
BORDER SECURITY_2015 (VOLUME  2 OF 2),9/14/2015,    Correct.,brown
BORDER SECURITY_2015 (VOLUME  2 OF 2),9/14/2015,"    Thank you, Senator, for the opportunity to _x000D_
speak before the Committee today, and I will just reemphasize _x000D_
that for us in the Coast Guard, the most important aspect of us _x000D_
being able to maintain maritime border security for decades to _x000D_
come is going to be the recapitalization of the cutter fleet _x000D_
through the Offshore Patrol Cutter Program. So your continued _x000D_
support for that will help us out greatly in accomplishing not _x000D_
only drug interdiction but all the other missions to which we _x000D_
are appointed.",brown
